# Petpals, The Pet Adoption Platform
PetPals, The Pet Adoption Platform scenario is a software system designed to facilitate the adoption of 
pets, such as dogs and cats, from shelters or rescue organizations. This platform serves as a digital 
marketplace where potential adopters can browse and select pets, shelters can list available pets, and 
donors can contribute to support animal welfare.
